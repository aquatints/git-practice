# Determine Target Heart Rate Zone
# Assigned to: Wen

# Comments describe what needs to be done, obviously ;P

# prompt user for age

# calculate max heart rate by doing 220 - age

# print max hr

# prompt user for resting heart rate, or allow user to enter a ? for 65 as a guess

# calculate Heart Rate Reserve (HRR); HRR=MaxHR-RestHR

# calculate lower bound of training zone (70% of HRR)

# calculate upper bound of training zone (85% of HRR)

# print lower and upper bound in the format [Lower, Upper]
